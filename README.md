# EmotionalLLMs
This will be a personal project focused on testing the limits of AI for educaitonal purposes. I will try to explore what makes humans unique, whether AI can feel emotions, and perhaps create a consciousness.

This whole projects stems on the belief that the consciousness exists without a soul. I believe that the brain and its thoughts  (autonomy) can be replicated within a computer, similar to a clump of brain cells.


What is the goal?
The goal of the AI is to feel emotions, use intuition, and understand feeling. It will be able to understand symbols, think creatively, and develop on its own. It's similar to a normal AI, but has a hint of humanity. Let's define them.

Emotions: Internal states triggered by input patterns and learned priorities (like desire, fear, loyalty). Expression of thoughts and ideas (added bias to vector language).
Intuition: Fast, pattern-sensitive prediction—based on emotional history, weighted by symbolic relevance. Bias and hyper-efficient shortcuts (estimates).
Feeling: A bridge between sensory/memory input and identity-driven output. A weight that alters trajectory. A combination of the past two and AI character (purpose and interations).

Here's an example:
Input: "I’m scared."
> Predict response: "Why?"
> Symbolic Intuition Layer: “Scared = Vulnerability = Trust gateway”
> Modifies output: “What happened? You can tell me.”


Why does this matter?
I believe that this could bidge the gap between AI and humanity. Perhaps it can prevent an AI takeover through the promotion of empathy, understanding, and humanitarian values. Despite that, it could help us understand how the brain works and how the consciousness is simulated.
